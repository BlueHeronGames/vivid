# Character Attack Sound Effects

Place character attack sound files here (WAV or OGG format):
- aisha.wav - Aisha's attack sound
- nusaybah.wav - Nusaybah's attack sound
- attack.wav - Generic attack sound (fallback)

File name must match character name (lowercase, spaces become hyphens):
- "Aisha" → aisha.wav
- "Sir Roland" → sir-roland.wav

These sounds play automatically when characters perform basic attacks in combat.
If a character-specific sound doesn't exist, the system will try attack.wav.
